## Instructions

Complete the method `powersOfThree()` so that it takes two integers, `n` and `m`, and prints all the powers of three inclusively between `n` and `m` on one line. If `m` is less than `n`, it prints nothing.  

Here are some examples: 


```
powersOfThree(1, 300); // prints:
                       // 1 3 9 27 81 243

powersOfThree(25, 800); // prints:
                        // 27 81 243 729

powersOfThree(-100, 3); // prints:
                        // 1 3
```

**Reminder:** Multiples of three are not the same thing as powers of three.

**Hint:** Inefficient solutions tend to be the simplest to write for these kinds of problems. Start by getting an inefficient solution working and then try to modify it little by little to make it more efficient.

## Main.java

Here is the original code in case you need to refer to it:

```java
/**
 * @author name
 */

public class Main {
  
  /**
   * Takes two integers, n and m, and prints all the powers of three inclusively between n and m.
   * 
   * @param n any positive integer
   * @param m any integer greater than or equal to n
   */
  public static void powersOfThree(int n, int m) {
    /*
     * What goes here?
     */    
  }

  /**
   * 
   * @param args the command line arguments
   * @return void
   */
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      /*
       * Write your own tests here.
       */
    }
  }
}

```
