## Instructions

Complete the program so that the method `secondLowestNum()` returns the second lowest number in an array of doubles **without sorting the array**. If the array has fewer than two items, it returns `0.0`.

**Hint:** Consider finding the lowest number first, then ignoring it when you are finding the second lowest number.

## Main.java

Here is the original code in *Main.java* for reference:

```java
/**
 *
 * @author name
 */

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    
  /**
   * Takes an array of doubles and returns the second lowest double.
   * 
   * If the array is empty or has only one item, it returns 0.0.
   * 
   * Does not sort the array as a part of its algorithm.
   *
   * @param array
   * @return double
   */
  public static double secondLowestNum(double[] array) {
    /*
     * What goes here?
     */
    return 0.0;
  }
      
  /**
   * @param args the command line arguments
   */
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    /*
     * Write your own tests here.
     */
  } 
}

```
