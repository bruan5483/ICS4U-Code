## Instructions

Create a method called `reverseFile()` that takes a filename and writes every character in it in reverse order to a new file that spells the filename in reverse. For example, if the content of `textfile.txt` is `Hello World!`, the method would create the file file `eliftxet.txt` and it would contain `!dlroW olleH`. 

Include all the Javadoc documentation just like the previous assignments:
* `@author` tag at the top of the file
* Method documentation for each method:
  *  A brief description of what the method does.
  * `@param` tag (if applicable)
  * `@return` tag (if applicable)
* Line comments within methods to explain your thinking

## Main.java

Here is the original code in case you need to refer to it:

```jaba
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  }
}
```
