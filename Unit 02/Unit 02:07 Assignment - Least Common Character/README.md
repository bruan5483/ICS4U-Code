## Instructions

Complete the program so that the method `leastCommonChar()` returns the character in the string `s` that has the lowest positive frequency (i.e. it occurs the fewest number of times). If there is a tie between two or more characters, the method returns the one at the highest index. If the string is empty, the method returns the character with an ASCII value of zero.

**Hint:** Consider creating a helper method that calulates the frequency of a character in a string.

## Main.java

Here is the original code in *Main.java* for reference:

```java
/**
 *
 * @author name
 */
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
  
  /**
   * This method takes a string and returns the least common character in it.
   *
   * If there is a tie, it returns the one at the highest index.
   *
   * If the string is empty, it returns the character with ASCII value 0.
   *
   * @param s 
   * @return char
   */
  public static char leastCommonChar(String s) {
    /*
     * What goes here?
     */
    return (char)0;
  }
      
  /**
   * @param args the command line arguments
   */
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    /*
     * Write your own tests here.
     */
  }
}


```
