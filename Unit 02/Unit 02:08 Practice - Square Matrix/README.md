## Instructions

A matrix (plural: matrices) is a 2D grid of numbers used in math (you may have seen them before if you've taken Grade 12 Data Management or Calculus and Vectors). 

Complete the program so that the method `isSquareMatrix()` returns `True` if `matrix` is a square matrix and `False` otherwise. A matrix is square if the number of rows is the same as the number of columns.

## Main.java

Here is the original code in *Main.java* for reference:

```java
/**
 *
 * @author name
 */

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    
  /**
   * Takes a 2-dimensional array of integers and determines whether it is a square matrix (i.e. the number of rows is the same as the number of columns).
   *
   * @param matrix
   * @return boolean
   */
  public static boolean isSquareMatrix(int[][] matrix) {
    /*
     * What goes here?
     */
    return true;
  }
      
  /**
   * @param args the command line arguments
   */
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    /*
     * Write your own tests here.
     */
  }   
}

```
